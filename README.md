# AI or Not?

A web app that lets you detect AI-generated text and challenge yourself to distinguish between human and AI writing through an interactive guessing game.

## Features

- **AI vs Human Text Detection:** Paste any text and instantly see the probability that it was written by AI, visualized with a progress bar.
- **AI vs Human Text Guessing Game:** Play a 3-round game where you guess whether each text was written by a human or AI, with instant feedback and scoring.

## How to Start the App

It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

1. **Create a virtual environment**  
   (in your project directory):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**  
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

4. **Run the app**  
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Deactivate the virtual environment when done**  
   ```
   deactivate
   ```

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
